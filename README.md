# bootstrap-resume

#Instructions:

Take your HTML Resume and update it using bootstrap!
- Start a new project for this excercise:
-Once you are in VS Code you will need to create a new index file, and a new css file, then include the css inside the <head> of your html.
-You will also need to include the bootstrap code inside the <head> of your html as well.
-Once you've got that set up, start to build out your resume!

Include the following items:
-Navigation
-Intro (perhaps the jumbotron?)
-Some skills
-Cards that highlight some of your projects (include links)
-Contact Info
-Links to social networks

#What I did
I set up two pages to showcase my knowledge of bootstrap along with my class skills. It was much faster with Bootstrap than with just CSS. This is my commit before class on Tuesday, and I hope to work on it more to try out some more Bootstrap options.
